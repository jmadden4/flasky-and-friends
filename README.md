# Flasky-and-Friends
======

Miguel Grinberg's [Flasky](https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/flasky) helped inspire this FrankenStack repository that has allowed me to test & learn an evergrowing set of features. 

Flasky relies upon a SQLAlchemy database that has been modified to allow users to add dogs :dog::dog::dog: to their account profile. 

Flasky and friends also includes
* Kafka via python-kafka (see [/kafka-utils](/kafka-utils) for some 
* Natural Language Processing via Delbot (https://github.com/shaildeliwala/delbot)
* Spark via pyspark (...coming soon!)
